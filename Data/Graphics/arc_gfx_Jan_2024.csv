Click or the topic for details:

Identify the problem
Take note of error messages, symptoms, and what you were doing when the problem occurred. Can you replicate the problem? This information is critical for determining the issue affecting your system.

Note	If you are running the game for the first time on your current configuration, consider reducing the in-game settings or running the game in windowed mode. Performance can improve in some situations.
Is the issue with the game a new problem?
Check first to see if the problem you are experiencing has already been reported to the game developers, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of your system, or Intel.

Do a quick online search using the title of the game, a description of your problem, or any error message displayed. Check the Internet to see if others have reported the same issue, and if a solution is posted. Another good resource is the Intel Graphics Communities site.

Check game forums, official fan sites, and official support sites. These web resources can help you troubleshoot and correct issues you encounter with a specific game.

Update your game
Games that require an always-connected system, multi-player, or massively multi-player online (MMO) automatically update when you connect to their servers. However, single player games can have optional updates pushed out by their developer. Check the game Web site or use the provided game updating tool to make sure that the game is up-to-date.

Update your drivers
Check your computer manufacturer site for the latest driver updates. If drivers are not available from your manufacturer, you can browse for the appropriate driver on Download Center, or you use the Intel� Driver & Support Assistant (Intel� DSA) to have your system automatically find and install the latest compatible drivers.

To perform a clean installation of the latest graphics driver see Clean Installation of Intel� Graphics Drivers in Windows*.

Update your BIOS
Download the latest BIOS update for your system directly from your OEM. A BIOS update can fix compatibility issues between your motherboard and processor, and can also improve overall performance.
